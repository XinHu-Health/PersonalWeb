# Personal Website

This is the README file for my personal/academic website, built using Blogdown with Hugo and Coder theme. The coder theme is available at https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder.git.

Here are some very basic instructions for building your website in a similar fashion:<br>

1. Install blogdown in R and update all packages. Blogdown has lots of dependencies so evertyhing needs to be updated.

2. Use blogdown to install hugo, blogdown::install_hugo()

3. Build site using coder theme, blogdown::new_site(theme="luizdepra/hugo-coder")
