# Data from my projects

I’m working to organize some of the publicly available datasets that I use more frequently (mainly Medicare Advantage and HCRIS) and associated code files. These are available as part of separate *GitHub* repositories. For code that is more specific to a given project, please see the repositories under those individual projects/papers on my research page.

- [Medicare Advantage](https://github.com/imccart/Medicare-Advantage)
- [Healthcare Cost Report Information System](https://github.com/imccart/HCRIS)


# External data sources

Here I've collected some handy data resources that I've come across over time. Most of these are data search engines or specific websites that I find valuable and that I reference semi-regularly. Hat tip to [D. Sebastian Tello-Trillo](https://dsebastiantello.wordpress.com/) for organizing many of these data sources on his own resources page. 

- Try [Google's database search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/). It's officially out of beta mode as of January 2020. 
- Consider joining [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural). This is a newsletter that sends out a few lesser-known datasets every week. You can also peruse their archive.
- [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/) is a data search-engine provided by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Lots of good info.
- [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) is a repository for papers, often with links to specific data sources and code files where available.
- [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) is a common data source for macroeconomic variables maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
- Long list of valuable datasets from the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/data/).
- [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/index.shtml) provides a list of several datasets from several different underlying surveys.
- List of datasets sponsored by the CDC at [CDC Wonder](https://wonder.cdc.gov/WelcomeT.html).
- Data from the [Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](http://www.bea.gov/).
- Historic data can be hard to find. These lists from [Historical Statistics](http://www.historicalstatistics.org/) can help.
- A short list of datasets for economics compiled by the [AEA](http://rfe.org/showCat.php?cat_id=2).


# Learning and methods

It’s always nice to learn new things, freshen-up on things we thought we learned before, or just hear things again from a different perspective. Below are a few resources that I’ve found valuable specifically for econometric methods.

- [NBER Lectures](http://www.nber.org/SI_econometrics_lectures.html) are very well done and presented by the best in their respective fields.
- Like the NBER Lectures, the [AEA Continiung Education](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed) webcasts are great for learning new methods, even if you couldn’t attend the pre-conference workshops.
- Want to learn Python like a secret government spy? Take a look at the [NSA's Python Course](https://archive.org/details/comp3321/mode/2up/search/device), made available by a freedom of information act request from [Chris Swenson](http://caswenson.com/).
- Some free econometrics textbooks!
  - [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](http://scunning.com/mixtape.html) by Scott Cunningham
  - [Causal Inference Book](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) by Jamie Robin and Miguel Hernan
  - [Econometrics](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/) by Bruce Hansen
  - [Introductory Econometrics](https://github.com/NickCH-K/econometrics) class notes from Nick Huntington-Klein
- For a great resource on `R` and lots of important data science topics, see Grant McDermott's [Data science for economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) GitHub repository
- Ever wish you had a central resource for lots of little commands and how to do things in different stats packages? Nick Huntington-Klein thought the same thing in his [Library of Statistical Techniques (LOST)](https://lost-stats.github.io/).


# Writing and presenting like an academic

Academics aren't known for their patience, and economists are probably worse than most. Learning how to write concisely and present effectively for your audience is critical. Here are some helpful links (hat tip to [Christoph Kronenberg](https://sites.google.com/view/christoph-kronenberg/home/resources) and [Amanda Agan](https://sites.google.com/site/amandayagan/Home) for gathering many these on their websites first)

# Discussing other people's work

Academics are good at offering criticism, sometimes not so constructively, sometimes just wrong, sometimes mean, and sometimes wrong and mean at the same time. Follow some of these guides to make sure you don't fall in the latter category.

# Some fun packages

There are so many incredible things that people are doing in applied econometrics right now. This material seems to come out fast, and I often find myself with dozens of bookmarks that I forget or quickly lose track of. So, here's where I've decided to list some of the new programs and packages that I think are particularly useful for applied researchers. This is not comprehensive by any means...just a way to keep track of new programs that I either actively use in my work or that I want to start using.

- `R` package for the Goodman-Bacon decomposition, [bacondecomp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bacondecomp/index.html). It also exists for Stata.
- [Randomization Inference "Sandbox"](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/econometrics-sandbox-randomization-inference-event-study-designs) from the World Bank.
- [panelView](https://yiqingxu.org/software/panelView/panelView.html) is a great way to visualize treatment timing in your data
- Present your regression results and summary statistics neatly with [modelsummary](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/) in `R`
- Simple summary statistics in `R` with `vtable::sumtable()` from Nick Huntington-Klein, package code available [here](https://github.com/NickCH-K/vtable)
- An `R` package for specification curves, [rdfanalysis](https://github.com/joachim-gassen/rdfanalysis)
- Really fast regression with fixed effects in `R`, [fixest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fixest/index.html)
- `R` package for sensitivity analysis of OLS and IV (sensitivity meaning sensitivity to unobserved confounders), [sensemakr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensemakr/index.html)


# Journey to Linux
This year, after becoming increasingly exhausted with Windows updates (why do I have to use Skype, Teams, etc.? Come on!), I decided to commit to Linux (Ubuntu). Here's the process I followed with links where available:

**Leaving Windows:**
Switching from Windows to Ubuntu is very simple. The first step is just to get a bootable version of Ubuntu on a flash drive. You can do that [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview).

**Basic setup:**
Getting an initial setup is also very easy. Here are a few key programs that I use just based on my personal preferences:

1. Google Chrome: Download the .deb file, `wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb`, and install using dpkg, `sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb`. More info [here](https://itsfoss.com/install-chrome-ubuntu/).

2. R and RStudio: Installing R is as simple as `sudo apt-get install r-base`. To get RStudio, you can download the .deb file [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and install using `sudo apt install ./rstudio-1.3.1093-amd64.deb` (depending on the file that you downloaded).

3. Text editor: I miss *Notepad++*. There's not really a clear Linux option, but you can do it via snapd...`sudo snap install notepad-plus-plus`. The functionality is pretty limited though, and interface is clunky. So I moved away from *Notepad++*. Now I'm using *Visual Studio Code* for all of my non-R text/coding work.

4. Email: I use Thunderbird as my Outlook replacement. It's an improvement because I can also include gmail, but some of the standard outlook features are different. Overall, I think I prefer Outlook but Thunderbird is a more than sufficient substitute. Plus it comes pre-installed on Ubuntu.

5. Cache git credentials in `R`: I still haven't fully figured this out with RStudio. Seems like I'm regularly prompted for my git user name and password even though I've followed all the steps I can find. I suspect that the cache is cleared every time I restart, otherwise it works well. But this is still a frustrating part of the process.

6. Windows: Gasp! How can you switch to Linux and still use Windows?! Well, I use OneNote heavily, and the only way to use OneNote with Linux is with a web-version. The web version doesn't have the same functionality as the desktop version, and there are some major latency issues. To solve this problem and gain full access to desktop OneNote, I had to resort to a virtual machine running Windows.
    - Creating a Virtual Machine. [These](https://github.com/Fmstrat/winapps/blob/main/docs/KVM.md) instructions worked well. One error I ran into was that the virtual machine wasn't connecting at first. I had to run `sudo virt-manager` after installing with `sudo apt-get install -y virt-manager`, after which everything ran smoothly. Note that you must have a the right version of Microsoft Office account for this to work. There are a lot of steps here.
    - Once you're set up, just run `virt-manager` from the command line to see your virtual machine and launch when needed.
    - Note...*WinApps* looks like a nice a way to launch several Windows Applications through a virtual machine in Linux. Much of the process is supposed to work in the background, so once things are setup, you should be able to open a program as you would any other program on Linux. This didn't work for me though, and since I really only need the virtual machine for Onenote, I don't mind the manual launch process. Still, if you want to give WinApps a shot, [here's](https://github.com/Fmstrat/winapps) a guide.
