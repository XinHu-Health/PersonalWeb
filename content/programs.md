# Stata Commands
Through some work with excellent mentors and co-authors [Daniel Millimet](https://faculty.smu.edu/millimet/) and [Rusty Tchernis](https://www.rustytchernis.com/), I've had an opportunity to help write a couple of Stata commands. Links and descriptions to these commands are below.

- [bmte](https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0355). This stands for bias-minimizing treatment effects. The goal of this estimator is to provide an estimate of the average treatment effect in cross-sectional settings where we know selection on observables is violated and where we do not have some other exclusion restriction or alternative identification strategy. The command implements the estimator proposed in [Millimet and Tchernis (2013)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jae.2286). 

- [tebounds](https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0386). This command implements several versions of Manski-type bounds for the average treatment effect in the case of a binary outcome and binary treatment. A particular advantage of these estimators is that they allow for potentially misreported and endogenous treatment status.


# Applied Empirical Micro Project
I'm actively working on an "interactive" econometrics project, the goal of which is to organize a handful of common econometric issues in applied empirical micro. The working title of this project is [Navigating Empirical Methods](https://empiricalmethods.netlify.app/). This resource is far from a comprehensive econometrics book, and the focus really isn't on covering the details of any specific estimator or methods. Rather, this will hopefully serve as a reference for the key things to keep in mind when implementing a given research design or estimation procedure, standard tests to consider, and alternative estimators (when relevant). Iâ€™m updating these things constantly as I find new information and correct my own misunderstanding. If you see something awry, please [let me know](mailto:ian.mccarthy@emory.edu)!
